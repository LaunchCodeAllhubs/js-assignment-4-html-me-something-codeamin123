      <h3>Since High School Graduation</h3>
      <p>Graduated high school in &#62;2007 without a clue on what I wanted to study or where I wanted to work.</p>
      <p>Went to the Community College of Philadelphia for two years to try to figure out what and where I wanted to study. I chose to study Psychology and eventually knew I wanted to go to Temple University</p>
      <p>I then decided to transfer to Millersville to live on campus and decide if I wanted to continue to study Psychology.</p>

      <p>After a year at Millersville, I decided to continue to study Psychology and attend Temple University back in Philadelphia.</p>

      <p>I graduated from Temple University with a Bachelors of Art degree in 2012.</p>
      <!--After Temple to current-->
      <p>After Graduating, I worked in retail (CVS,jewelry store) until getting my driver's license and applying for a job as a Counselor for adults with Mental Health Disorders</p>
      <p>Worked as a Counselor for around 1 year and 4 months until applying to my current job as a Parole/Probation Officer</p>
      <p>During my time as a Parole/Probation Officer, I started to hear more about coding. I decided to buy a few books to try to learn what this field was all about. After learning a little bit of python, I decided that the logic needed to complete the assignments was very interesting.</p>
      <p>I decided that I would like to pursue this as a full time career. I started to try to self-learn, but always gave up after I got to a part where it was difficult to continue</p>
      <p>Learned about LaunchCode through social media and decided to give it a try.</p>
      <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">As of today, I have worked as a Parole/Probation Officer for over 8 and a half years and I am currently in the first half of LaunchCode 101!</p>
